I've paid bills most of my adult life. Almost all of them were poorly formatted, don't show the data I care to see, and payment options are usually clumsy. A chance to redesign the cellphone bill is a refreshing opportunity. 

After looking at several cellphone and utility bills, I wanted to focus on what data is necessary so everything else can get out of the way. That led me to a user survey. 

After doing the survey, I found that seeing how usage broke down over a given month was helpful, as was how any taxes and fees entered into the equation. If someone went over, finding out where it happened is also helpful.

In our case, the person went over on their texts, and we're showing it on the breakdown as well as the activity history. It's simple to see where any problem starts. And in case of problems, the service will be smart enough to offer ways to help. Here, we're seeing an opportunity to upgrade a plan when going over its limit.

The activity log has been simplified to show real names if the user syncs their contact information, and everything is in easy-to-read text.

I built this site to be responsive and it works on mobile devices. I used Bootstrap, as well as wrote a little JavaScript to toggle the various activity logs. The CSS and JavaScript files were combined and minified so that the site would perform better. I wasn't able to combine everything, but I did it on everything that would live on the server.

The design needed a refreshing palette and iconography so I created something that had a quiet, but approachable personality. The typeface was Facit, which saves space from its compactness without compromising legibilty. The iconography is clear and helps someone make a connection to the type of data being displayed.
